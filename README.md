# Setup

Message alex to get everything setup and run the scripts. Still working on a way to do this without cloning another repo first to install the dependecies then cloning this repo to run the scripts. brrr

The main training script is train_grpo.py, while eval.py is used to evaluate the learned model after training. All other scripts are either in development or left around for archival purposes. You need at least ~40GB of VRAM on 1 gpu (think A100) to train these models.
